        Last Meeting
      </h2>

      <p>
        <span>In our last meeting, everyone was able to introduce themselves by saying their year,
        and their experience in CS. We shared each others schedules to determine a fixed weekly 
        time that we can meet. We settled on 7 pm after our CSE 110 lecture. We didn't have enough 
        time to share an interesting fact which we will do today. <br> <br>
        We also did a group bonding activity where we completed a group scavenger hunt around campus
        and grabbed food from price center. We cooperated really well during the scavenger and completed it within
        30 minutes. After we had lunch, we went to UTC and watched <i> Dune 2 </i> at the AMC movie theater.
        We all enjoyed the movie very much, so our bonding experience was great.

        Summary of Today's Meeting
      </h2>
        <p> In today's meeting, we finally were able to share one interesting fact about one another. 
          One fact that stood out the most was that one of our members can juggle while riding a unicycle 
          at the same time. We were also able to determine official roles which can be seen above in the
          attendance. We have two leaders who are Daniel and Matthew. We have one designer who is Wilson.
          Everyone else on the team will be developers. </p>
          
          <p> We split up into 5 groups of 2-3 people per group. Each group helped discuss about the plan for 
            this project. Unfortunately, we did not have enough time to come back together and discuss with what
            ideas we came up with. The reason that is is because as we were discussing the plan for this project,
            we were sidetracked by another topic: <em>anime</em>. We were talking about our favorite animes to one 
            another which was a great bonding experience. One of my personal favorites is <i>One Piece</i>. To show
            how great this anime really is, here is an edit of that anime below!</p>
